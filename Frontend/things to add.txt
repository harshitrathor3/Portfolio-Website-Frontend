add animation in project tech stack containers
add label in each project card like - ML/DL/AI/CNN/Image
hover over project to see its detail, (other project might get shift or adjust accordingly)

add search option in skills section - 
    if the skill is not present than that skill should be visible with little color change (may be dull color)
     and it should have caption like "currently learning this skill"

in resume section - my resume will be visible
    there should be section where people can paste the JD, skills, etc.
    and than after pressing a button they will get to know how relevant my resume is with the JD

keep all the prompts private and should not be visible in public repo

make use of vector database like pinecone, etc to get information from relevant data.
